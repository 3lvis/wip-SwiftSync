# State Capsule

## Plan

- [x] Add the four real journey tests for title edit, create, item edits, and people edits
- [x] Add only the accessibility hooks needed to drive those journeys reliably
- [x] Run the focused UI tests and required Demo app build, then update `.agents/state.md`
- [x] Update the `DemoUITests.swift` roadmap to remove low-value coverage and document the agreed harness work for empty/failure cases

## Last known state

Focused UI tests passed:
- `xcodebuild -project Demo/Demo.xcodeproj -scheme Demo -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=E8A7A5EE-68F6-4C30-952A-B75DF308E8D3' test -only-testing:DemoUITests/DemoUITests/testCreateTaskInsideProject`
- `xcodebuild -project Demo/Demo.xcodeproj -scheme Demo -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=E8A7A5EE-68F6-4C30-952A-B75DF308E8D3' test -only-testing:DemoUITests/DemoUITests/testUpdateTaskTitleKeepsProjectAndDetailInSync`
- `xcodebuild -project Demo/Demo.xcodeproj -scheme Demo -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=E8A7A5EE-68F6-4C30-952A-B75DF308E8D3' test -only-testing:DemoUITests/DemoUITests/testEditTaskItemsFlow`
- `xcodebuild -project Demo/Demo.xcodeproj -scheme Demo -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=E8A7A5EE-68F6-4C30-952A-B75DF308E8D3' test -only-testing:DemoUITests/DemoUITests/testEditTaskPeopleFlow`
- `xcodebuild -project Demo/Demo.xcodeproj -scheme Demo -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=E8A7A5EE-68F6-4C30-952A-B75DF308E8D3' build`

Planning update completed; no new tests/builds run because this pass only changed roadmap comments.

## Decisions (don't revisit)

- Start with a docs-only planning pass before any implementation work because this task is explicitly to define the rollout
- Split the automation roadmap into a baseline pass first and edge cases second to match the requested delivery shape
- Use a deterministic UI-test-only runtime configuration so launch assertions do not depend on persisted local cache or ambient backend mutations
- Keep the UI test target focused on maintained end-to-end coverage, not generated launch screenshots or placeholder performance tests
- The planning doc should be anchored to the seeded canonical demo data and actual screen states, not generic CRUD wording
- Making the Demo app intentionally easy to automate is in scope, including runtime and backend reshaping for deterministic UI states
- Build harness pieces only when a concrete UI flow needs them; avoid speculative test infrastructure
- The next planning layer should be user journeys, not screen permutations
- UI tests should map to user goals, not checkpoints like "screen opened successfully"
- `DemoUITests.swift` should be the active planning source for UI automation journeys
- Targeted per-journey UI test runs are more actionable than one large run while the suite is still being stabilized
- Remove placeholder journeys that only repeat existing CRUD coverage without adding a distinct regression target
- Empty/failure UI journeys are in scope when backed by explicit UI-test runtime hooks such as alternate seeds or injected failure behavior
